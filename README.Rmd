## Package Author's Notes

Data was available at URL as at 17/10/26. Data is imported into R and cleaned by removing redundant headers and transforming into a tidy format.

Airport ranking variable was removed: the interested party can recalculate.

Uses the annual airport traffic data from the Australian Government Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development located at: https://bitre.gov.au/publications/ongoing/airport_traffic_data.aspx

Contact details for the data itself can be found in the original spreadsheet, but please donâ€™t contact the aviation stats team for problems with the package!
